# Firebase Data Type Mismatch Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase applications where a type mismatch in the retrieved data causes unexpected behavior or crashes.

The `bug.js` file showcases how this error can occur if your app expects a specific data type (e.g., a number) but receives a different one (e.g., a string). This can lead to runtime errors.

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates how to handle this error gracefully by implementing robust data validation and type checking before processing the data from the Firebase database.
